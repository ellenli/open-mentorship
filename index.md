**#OpenMentorship** is a project founded by [Adam Whitcroft](http://twitter.com/adamwhitcroft) and it's a simple concept: we are donating our time and knowledge, free of charge, to anyone who could benefit from it to do good in their lives. What 'good' means is up to them. It could mean changing their own circumstance, or pushing for change within their community.

I'm extremely fortunate; I have skills that are transferable, in demand and have the ability to affect real change in one way or another. More importantly, I want to help people.

I'll be recording and making these sessions free and available[^1] to everyone. Sessions are for professional advice, design feedback or none of the above[^2]. There is no agenda.

If you'd like to help, [share this page](http://twitter.com/share?text=Read about %23OpenMentorship, a project by @adamwhitcroft) or - even better - get involved yourself[^3].
