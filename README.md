# #OpenMentorship

**#OpenMentorship** is a project founded by [Adam Whitcroft](http://twitter.com/adamwhitcroft) and it's a simple concept: we are donating our time and knowledge, free of charge, to anyone who could benefit from it to do good in their lives. What ‘good’ means is up to them. It could mean changing their own circumstance, or pushing for change within their community.

## How to book a session

To book a session with me, simply find a date and time that works for the both of us in my calendar. No fees, no strings attached.

*Please don’t use this time to solicit freelance or partnership work, or ask about confidential information pertaining to me or my employer.*

## How to get involved

If you'd like to offer your mentor services to others, you're awesome!

Here's a suggested set of steps to get going for yourself:

* Fork/check out [the original open-mentorship repo] created by @adamwhitcroft.
* Sign up for a booking service like [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) or [YouCanBookMe](https://www.youcanbook.me/).
* Decide how much time you would like to donate per week, and which times work best for you. I'm starting with 2 30 minute blocks on Wednesday evenings.
* Let people know! Use **#OpenMentorship** in your social media posts to help potential mentorees find you.
* Help other mentors get set up, or encourage people in your industry to get involved. :v:

The more people we get involved, the wider the skills on offer and the greater the impact we can collectively have. Let's be part of something bigger than ourselves.
